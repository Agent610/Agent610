### Hi there this is Devin Bhavsar ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student at Triple 10 Software Engineer student. 
My current goals as of now is to complete my Software Enginner program and find a job my main interest would be a job as a Software Engineer or Web Developer. 

I can state that I reached Triple 10 in September 2023 and it was one of the best programs that I met and had the honor to study in. 
I initially wanted to become a State-Trooper and work for the Connecticut State Police but my dream for a career in that agency never happened. 
Joining Triple 10 and potentially becoming a Software Engineer really made me change my career mindset. 
I look forward to future studies. 

If you want to reach out to me message me I will provide you with my contact information.
