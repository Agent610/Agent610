### Hi there this is Devin Bhavsar ðŸ‘‹
I'm now a graduate at Triple 10 Software Engineer student. 
My current goals as of now is to find a job my main interest would be a job as a Full-Stack Software Engineer with Back-end being my speciality. I feel that a career in Back-End development is more my capablity since I have two features: I enjoy it and I'm very good at it, I'm also good at front-end. 

I initially wanted to become a State-Trooper and work for the Connecticut State Police but my dream for a career in that agency never happened. 
Joining Triple 10 and potentially becoming a Software Engineer made me change my career mindset. 
Now that I have graduated my first and main priority is to find a job as a Software Engineer or even work in the back-end devlopment, also throughout my time in Triple 10 I have discovered an interest in tutoring, assisting students in their current sprint, based off exceling in the Software Engineer program I am confident that I can help a student in all 16 sprints in the course. 

If you want to reach out to me message me I will provide you with my contact information.
